## Patterns to Master (Critical for Medium)

To solve these problems faster, focus on mastering common techniques:

### Two-Pointer / Fast-Slow
Used in:
- Middle of Linked List
- Cycle detection & intersection
- Useful in reorder and rotate as well

### Dummy Node Technique
Great for insertion/deletion at heads without null checks.

### Reversal Sub-problems
Often reverse second half, merge halves, etc.

### Merge / Sort / Partitioning
Important for sort and merge variations.
